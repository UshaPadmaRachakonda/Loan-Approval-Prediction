# Loan Approval Prediction
Loan approval is a very important process for banking organizations. The system approved or reject the loan applications. Recovery of loans is a major contributing parameter in the financial statements of a bank. It is very difficult to predict the possibility of payment of loan by the customer. In recent years many researchers worked on loan approval prediction systems. Machine Learning (ML)techniques are very useful in predicting outcomes for large amount of data. In this project four machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression(LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost Classifier are applied to predict the loan approval of customers. The experimental results conclude that the accuracy of Logistic Regression machine learning algorithm is better as compared to Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost machine learning approaches.
